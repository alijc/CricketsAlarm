CricketsAlarm
=============

Android widget for keeping track of a pet's medications

This is a simple widget timer that rings an alarm 
to remind me to give Cricket (my diabetic tortie) a shot of insulin.
By default the alarm rings after 12 hours.  It can be 'snoozed' 
for an hour.

It's based largely on Thibault Jouannic's Napply.
